#Q: You are given as input an unsorted array of n distinct numbers, where n is a power of 2. 
#   Give an algorithm that identifies the second-largest number in the array, and that uses at most n + log2 nâˆ’2 comparisons.

#Q2: You are a given a unimodal array of n distinct elements,

#    after which its elements are in decreasing order. Give an algorithm to compute the maximum element that runs in O(log n) time.

            right = mid - 1

            left = mid + 1

    # Error condition: Array is not unimodal
